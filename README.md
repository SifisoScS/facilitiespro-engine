# 📦 FacilitiesPro

Welcome to the **FacilitiesPro**, the operational engine behind a legacy-driven dashboard system designed to dignify facilities work, celebrate stewardship, and modernize asset management with empathy and precision.

## 🚀 Project Status

✅ **Live as of August 20, 2025**

This launch marks the transition from inherited fragments to a unified backend system—powered by the **Sifiso Shezi Methodology** and guided by a philosophy of operational clarity, emotional intelligence, and cultural stewardship.

## 🧭 Philosophy

This backend is more than code—it's a **digital monument** to invisible labor, strategic stewardship, and the belief that systems can heal, honor, and empower. Every folder, function, and form reflects a commitment to:

* **Legacy over urgency**
* **Visibility over silence**
* **Clarity over chaos**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11+**
* **Flask** (modular API architecture)
* **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for asset data)
* **SQLite / SQL Server** (configurable)
* **Virtual Environment** (`venv`)
* **requirements.txt** (manually relocated to root for clarity)
